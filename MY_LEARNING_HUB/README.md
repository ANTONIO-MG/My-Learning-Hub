My Learning Hub is a comprehensive Learner Management System (LMS) designed to streamline and enhance the academic journey for students, educators, parents, and administrators. The web application, developed by Gerson Antonio, aims to replace traditional paper-based academic management systems with a modern, technology-driven solution.

In the course of developing this project, I have garnered valuable experience and implemented various applications to enhance its functionality. Among these applications is a To-Do app, designed to help users organize and manage tasks efficiently. Additionally, a basic Customer Relationship Management (CRM) app has been integrated, focusing on improving interactions and information management with users. Furthermore, a Chat app has been implemented to facilitate real-time communication among different stakeholders within the system. These applications contribute to the overall richness and versatility of the project, providing users with a comprehensive platform for task management, customer relations, and seamless communication.

Student Dashboard: View grades, upcoming events, and assignments. Access a basic class chatroom for improved communication.

Student and Employee Management: Apply for leave and sick days, manage profiles, and access general communication channels.

General School Communication: Engage with Heads of Departments (HODs) through school-wide chat for important announcements and updates.
